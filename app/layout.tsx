// Purpose: Define the layout for the application. This is the root layout that will be used for all pages.
// This layout is used to define the global styles for the application.
// The layout incorporates the Navbar, Footer, and the main content of the page.
// This is also where the sheet of paper effect is achieved; The entirety of the page looks like its on a sheet of paper, with a shadow around the edges.
// This effect is achieved by keeping the body as a background while the children are wrapped in a div with a paper-esq background and a shadow, that's width is less than a full page width.
// Color Scheme: FE904F, 4076FF, and dark being 333333
